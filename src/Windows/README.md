## Maps


- **MapView**

    * [Change viewpoint](ArcGISRuntime.Windows.Samples/Samples/MapView/ChangeViewpoint)

    This sample demonstrates how the current viewpoint can be changed. This Sample opens with a default service viewpoint. Each subsequent button click will change the viewpoint using different methods (one to a provided extent, another a point and scale, and another to rotate the viewpoint by 90 degrees.

    * [Map rotation](ArcGISRuntime.Windows.Samples/Samples/MapView/MapRotation)

    This sample demonstrates how to rotate a map.


- **Map**

    * [Set initial map location](ArcGISRuntime.Windows.Samples/Samples/Map/SetInitialMapLocation)

    This sample creates a map with a standard ESRI Imagery with Labels basemap that is centered on a latitude and longitude location and zoomed into a specific level of detail.

    * [Set initial map area](ArcGISRuntime.Windows.Samples/Samples/Map/SetInitialMapArea)

    This sample displays a map at a specific viewpoint. In this sample a viewpoint is constructed from an envelope defined by minimum (x,y) and maximum (x,y) values. The map's initialViewpoint is set to this viewpoint before the map is loaded. Upon loading the map zooms to this initial area.

    * [Set map spatial reference](ArcGISRuntime.Windows.Samples/Samples/Map/SetMapSpatialReference)

    This sample demonstrates how you can set the spatial reference on a Map and all the layers would project accordingly.

## Layers


- **Tiled Layers**

    * [ArcGIS tiled layer (URL)](ArcGISRuntime.Windows.Samples/Samples/Layers/ArcGISTiledLayerUrl)

    The Tiled Layer from URL sample is one of the most basic .Net SDK samples. This example covers using ArcGISTiledLayer as a Basemap, as well as adding the required map and MapView elements. By default, this map supports basic zooming and panning operations.


- **Map Image Layers**

    * [ArcGIS map image layer (URL)](ArcGISRuntime.Windows.Samples/Samples/Layers/ArcGISMapImageLayerUrl)

    The image layer from URL sample is one of the most basic .Net SDK samples. This example covers using ArcGISMapImageLayer as a Basemap, as well as adding the required map and MapView elements. By default, this map supports basic zooming and panning operations.

## Features


- **Feature Layers**

    * [Feature layer definition expression](ArcGISRuntime.Windows.Samples/Samples/Layers/FeatureLayerDefinitionExpression)

    This sample demonstrates how to apply definition expression to a feature layer for filtering features. It also shows how to reset the definition expression.
